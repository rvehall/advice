React Native advice app

This uses expo. Use the [basic setup](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started)

`npm install -g expo-cli`

`npm install` or `yarn install`

`npm start`, `yarn start`, or `expo start`

This uses external APIs that I did not build: [https://geek-jokes.sameerkumar.website/](https://geek-jokes.sameerkumar.website/),
